    <h1>So</h1>
    <p>This year I'm going to build one thing every month.</p>
    <p class="strong">12 projects.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I often have ideas but I struggle to follow through and actually make them a reality.</p>
    <p>Making this public will help me to be held accountable for completing my ideas.</p>
    <p>I want to use this as a way to learn new skills and improve my current skill set.</p>
    <p>Also, I want to share my work with you.</p>
    <p>Maybe something great will come out of it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <h2>What will you build?</h2>
    <p>This is my list in no particular order. Some things may change along the way.</p>
    <p>It's not all software. Some of these things are hardware based.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Blog platform</h3>
        <p>A barebones content management system to write blog posts about my projects.</p>
        <p>This page is part of it! (Although it doesn't have <em>any</em> features yet.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>LED dog collar</h3>
        <p>An LED, battery powered, multi coloured collar for my dog. So she'll look super stylish at the dog park.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cross stitch pattern generator</h3>
        <p>A suggestion from my wife. It will turn a photo into a bunch of coloured squares that can be used as a cross stitch pattern.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bicycle customisation</h3>
        <p>I want to customise my bike to include some kind of carrier on the back and some safety lights for night time biking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tournament management software</h3>
        <p>An app that will facilitate team, player and tournament management (for basketball).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>iOS game</h3>
        <p>Haven't yet decided what kind of game to build but I want to refresh my iOS development skills.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Rasperry Pi solar powered security camera</h3>
        <p>Self explanatory. A security camera that runs off solar power and saves regular backups of footage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Vintage radio restoration</h3>
        <p>Taking an old vintage tube radio and replacing the electronics to support digital radio and bluetooth.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Arcade/video game</h3>
        <p>A clone of an old arcade or video game like Pacman, Tetris or Space Invaders.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Torrent downloader</h3>
        <p>A self contained box on my home network that will download torrents on demand via either text message or some kind of chat bot. Doubles as a media server.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Pantry inventory tracker</h3>
        <p>An app that keeps track of what's in my fridge and pantry. Supports barcode scanning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Base pattern draw</h3>
        <p>Another suggestion from my wife. A tool that will draw a base pattern given a person's body measurements.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
